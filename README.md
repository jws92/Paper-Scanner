# Paper Scanner
* I implemented a paper scanner with DCNN for practice.
* I modified some parts of VGG model.
* The data was collected from Google somewhere..
* Now that the amount of the data is very very small, I just used all of the data as the training set.
  So, there are no test set and test code for the trained model.

# Requirements
* PyTorch 1.7.1 + cu110
* TorchVision 0.8.2
* CUDA 11.2
* OpenCV 4.5.2
* Numpy 1.21.0
* Pillow 8.2.0
* timm 0.4.12
* torchinfo 1.5.3
